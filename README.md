 Mobile Apps Final Project
This project is a project for my mobile apps class, it a webbased type of application when ran through cordova gives you an app like experience. It is a COVID-19 app that you have a login screen, a signup screen, and then you get to the user experience screen where you can search you location, favorite the location, then have three buttons that you can click to display data for covid 19 based on the location.
